### Design:

<p> The website implements Google's material design. You can read more about it <a href="google.com">here</a>

### Reporting an issue

If you find a bug or would like to add a suggestion/feature, you can do it using Github Issues.

### Firebase access

~~The API keys for firebase are masked. If you'd like to access firebase for debugging or deployment purposes shoot us an email at dev@sjsumsa.org~~

The API keys are no longer masked, firebase is now programmed to check the URL of the website the request it is sent it from, it needs to match `sjsumsa.org`. There's no longer a security vulnerability

### Architecture

The website built as a single page application:

`www/index.html` contains the HTML file in which the app is appended to. Include in this file all the meta tags, open graph attributes and cdns

The react application is appended to the app id in the index file.

Main.js contains all the Components used by the website. You can overwrite the default palette by changing the MUI-Theme variable

You'll find each of the components in the app directory
